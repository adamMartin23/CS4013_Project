The finalised project is stored in the file called CS4013_Final_Version.
All CSV files are stored in New_Project_CSVs.

You need to create a SystemStart object using the file address of your CSVs. Eg. "C:\Users\user1\OneDrive\Documents\Year 2\CS4013_Final_Project\New_Project_CSVs".

The program starts by giving a prompt to enter an Student or Department.
Student is followed by student id number.


Department password is (passwordDepartment)
Student password is (passwordStudent) regardless of the entered ID.

If you are a student:
You can then use any of the prompted messages to see your transcript, modules, etc.

If you are a department:
You can then use any of the prompted messages to see students transcript, grades, add modules/programs/grades etc.

Enter Q to quit out of the system.
